This JavaScript code manages the interactivity and responsiveness of a hamburger menu and navigation list in a webpage. Here's a detailed explanation:

### **1. Wait for the DOM to Load**
```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => { ... });
```
- The `DOMContentLoaded` event ensures the script runs only after the HTML document has been fully loaded and parsed. This prevents errors from accessing DOM elements that may not yet exist.

### **2. Select Relevant Elements**
```javascript
const hamburger = document.querySelector(".hamburger");
const navList = document.querySelector(".nav-list");
```
- `hamburger`: Selects the element representing the hamburger icon.
- `navList`: Selects the navigation list element that toggles visibility.

### **3. Toggle Navigation List on Hamburger Click**
```javascript
hamburger.addEventListener("click", () => {
    navList.style.display = navList.style.display === "flex" ? "none" : "flex";
});
```
- Adds a `click` event listener to the hamburger icon.
- Toggles the `display` style of the `navList`:
  - If `navList` is currently displayed (`"flex"`), it is hidden by setting `display` to `"none"`.
  - If `navList` is hidden, it is made visible by setting `display` to `"flex"`.
- This allows the user to open and close the menu dynamically on smaller screens.

### **4. Adjust Navigation Visibility on Window Resize**
```javascript
window.addEventListener("resize", () => {
    if (window.innerWidth >= 768) {
        navList.style.display = "flex"; // Show nav on larger screens
    } else {
        navList.style.display = "none"; // Hide nav by default on smaller screens
    }
});
```
- Adds a `resize` event listener to the `window` object, which triggers whenever the browser window size changes.
- Ensures that the navigation menu behaves appropriately for different screen sizes:
  - If the screen width is `768px` or larger:
    - Navigation is always displayed as a horizontal menu (`"flex"`).
  - If the screen width is smaller than `768px`:
    - Navigation is hidden (`"none"`), preparing it to be toggled by the hamburger menu.

### **Key Features of the Code**
1. **Dynamic Menu Toggle**:
   - The `click` event on the hamburger icon allows users to toggle the visibility of the navigation menu on smaller screens.

2. **Responsive Design Handling**:
   - The `resize` event ensures the navigation menu is always displayed correctly for different screen sizes:
     - Always visible on larger screens.
     - Hidden by default on smaller screens for a clean, mobile-friendly experience.

3. **User-Friendly Behavior**:
   - Avoids issues where the navigation menu might remain hidden or incorrectly styled when resizing the window.

### **Example Workflow**
1. **Page Load**:
   - The navigation menu is hidden if the screen is below `768px`.
   - It is displayed if the screen width is `768px` or more.

2. **User Interaction**:
   - On small screens, clicking the hamburger icon toggles the menu's visibility.

3. **Window Resizing**:
   - Switching between small and large screen sizes dynamically updates the navigation menu's visibility to match the design intent.

This code ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience while adhering to responsive design principles.
