### Notes on Responsiveness in the Stylesheet

This stylesheet demonstrates a mobile-first approach to responsive design, focusing on layout flexibility, typographic scaling, and adaptive content presentation. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of its responsiveness features:

---

#### **1. Box-Sizing for Consistent Layouts**
- `*`, `*::before`, `*::after { box-sizing: border-box; }`
  - Ensures padding and borders are included in element dimensions, making layouts more predictable and consistent across all screen sizes.

---

#### **2. Mobile-First Design**
- Default styles prioritize smaller screens, with properties like `flex-direction: column` and `width: 100%` to stack content vertically.
- Uses flexible units like `em`, `rem`, and percentages for scalable typography, padding, and width.

---

#### **3. Flexible Typography**
- **Font Sizes:** 
  - Uses `rem` for responsive scaling (`h1 { font-size: 2.5rem; }`), ensuring typography adjusts proportionally to the root font size.
  - Media query adjustments increase `h1` font size to `5vw` on larger screens, maintaining a visually balanced hierarchy.
- **Responsive Text Transformation:**
  - Text-transform properties (e.g., `uppercase` for `.beta-text`) ensure consistent visual emphasis without altering font size.

---

#### **4. Responsive Flexbox Layouts**
- **Containers (`.intro` and `.main-content`):**
  - Default flex properties like `flex-direction: column` for mobile.
  - Adaptive alignment with `justify-content` and `align-items` for dynamic spacing.
- Media queries introduce a two-column layout at larger screen sizes (`width: 50%;`).

---

#### **5. Responsive Forms**
- **Input and Button Styles:**
  - Use `width: 100%;` for form elements, ensuring full-width inputs on small screens.
  - Media queries adjust spacing and layout for larger screens, retaining usability.

---

#### **6. Media Queries for Larger Screens**
- `@media (min-width: 576px)` refines styles for screens above 576px:
  - **Body Layout:** Converts to a flex container, splitting `.intro` and `.main-content` into side-by-side columns.
  - **Typography:** Scales font sizes (e.g., `h1 { font-size: 5vw; }` for responsive heading sizes).
  - **Container Adjustments:** Expands `.intro` to full height (`min-height: 100vh`) and centers `.main-content`.

---

#### **7. Adaptive Images**
- **`.img-main { width: 120px; border-radius: 50%; }`:**
  - Ensures profile images maintain consistent dimensions and styling.
  - Default width scales well within the flex container, adaptable for different screen widths.

---

### **Key Responsive Techniques Used**
1. **Mobile-First Approach:** Default small-screen styles refined for larger screens with media queries.
2. **Flexible Units:** 
   - `rem` and `em` for typography.
   - Percentages for flexible width and max-width constraints.
3. **Flexbox Layouts:** Ensures content reflows dynamically while maintaining alignment.
4. **Viewport Units:** Scales heading sizes using `vw` for responsiveness on wider screens.
5. **Box-Sizing:** Simplifies element dimension management for consistent layouts.
