100 Days of Code - Full Stack Developer Journey

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge! This repository documents my journey as I commit to learning and building projects from scratch to enhance my skills as a **Full Stack Developer**. 

🚀 Starting Point: HTML  
I am beginning this journey by mastering the basics of **HTML** and will progress through various technologies, including **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. The goal is to push consistent updates and projects here as I grow as a developer.

 📂 Project Structure

Each project I complete will be organized into separate folders for easy navigation:
```
/project-folder-name
    ├── index.html
    ├── styles.css
    ├── script.js
    └── README.md
```

- **HTML:** Initial projects will focus on web structure and markup.
- **CSS:** As I progress, I'll style my projects with CSS to ensure they are responsive and visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** Later, dynamic functionality will be added to enhance interactivity.
